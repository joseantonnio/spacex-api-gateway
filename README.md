# SpaceX API Gateway

This API Gateway uses [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) to get the SpaceX upcoming, last, next, and previous rocket launches.

Alternatively, the [Ruby SpaceX API](https://github.com/victorperez/spacex-api-ruby) gem could be used in this project. But this project's objective is to present a complete implementation.

## Ruby version

Ruby 3.1.2 is used in this project. You can also see this information in the `.ruby-version` file.

## Configuration

Install [Ruby Version Manager (RVM)](https://rvm.io/) following your current operational system tutorial also available in RVM docs.

Be sure that you're using the correct ruby and gemset via RVM and run `bundle install` to configure your environment.

You can run this project locally using `rails serve -p PORT`, changing `PORT` by an unused port from 0 to 65536.

## Deployment instructions

This project is configured to auto-deploy to Railway when a new commit is added to the main branch.
